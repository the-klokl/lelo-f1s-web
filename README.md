> made by klokl

## how to use

0. install [elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html)
1. `elm make --output=assets/elm.js src/elm/BtLelo.elm`
2. open `bt-lelo.html` in a browser

if i get bored or enough people care, i might make a github action that makes a github page out of this

## what it's for

apart from the obvious usage, you can also reference [this](src\js\BtLelo.js) when learning how to make a web app that uses [bluetooth capabilities of your browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API)
